Shortly before PAX West 2019, a stroke of good mazel brought Glitch Kibbitz into existence. Our first performance took place in PAX's Jamspace, featuring 9 original arrangements of video game tunesâ€”all written and practiced in the month before the event. (Hopefully it didn't show too much...)

After PAX, GK continued to expand their repertoire, and followed up with a performance at the MAGFest 2020 Belvedere Lobby Bar. In the years since, we've collaborated remotely, creating several tracks for Materia Community albums, 2 singles, and 4 EPs. We're excited to make our return to the stage in 2025. Stay tuned for more information!

Glitch Kibbitz is composed of 7 musicians:

* Nikola Whallon (violin)
* Kevin Vitz-Wong (clarinet)
* Brandon Hailey (saxophone)
* Tyler Eveland (trombone)
* Shir Goldberg (bass)
* Sam DeVarti (accordion)
* Josh Klopfenstein (percussion)
